# Fake Review Detection Using Deep Neural Networks with Multimodal Feature Fusion

This project explores advanced deep learning techniques to detect fake reviews on e-commerce platforms by combining textual, behavioral, and temporal data.

- Overview :
  Fake reviews undermine consumer trust and distort online marketplaces. This project implements and demonstrates ideas from three cutting-edge research papers using a Jupyter Notebook:

- Techniques Covered:
  BMTBA Model: BERT + TextCNN + BiGRU + Attention + Review Weekday feature
  HACNN Model: Hierarchical Attention + DCNN + Adam Archery Optimizer
  Multimodal Survey Insights: Early, Intermediate, Late Fusion strategies

- Features Extracted:
  Textual (TF-IDF)
  Temporal (Review Weekday)
  Behavioral (rating deviation, punctuation count, etc.)
